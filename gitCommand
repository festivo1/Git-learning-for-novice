git init   //make a .git hidden folder in your local repo
vim utsav.txt  // create a file 
git status   // checking the stauts of the file whether it is ready to commit to the github or not

git config --global user.name "festivo1"
git config --global user.name "utsavbhetwal2008@yahoo.com"

git commit -m "Inital commit" // commit the staged files to master and provide the name "initial commit" as a first commit
If second time "second commit" 

git log   ------------to see the time of commit

git remote -v -------------to see the local repo ko naam

no name given so blanK.
solution:
create a remote repository as Github-learning in github and connect local  repository by following command:

git remote add origin https://github.com/festivo1/Github-learning.git

To remove the connection with the master:
git remote remove origin

Here origin is the name given. YOu can type any name 
After connection, push the local repository to remote:

git push origin master ----------origin is the local repository name or 

branch and master is the remote master branch
Then asks for username and password

Username for 'https://github.com': festivo1
Password for 'https://festivo1@github.com': Eloquence2

Then the file is pushed to github repository


Note:
create .gitignore file so that the files inside this folder won't be pushed to github 


Deploying to heroku
--------------------------------------

git init   //make a .git hidden folder in your local repo
vim utsav.txt  // create a file 
git status   // checking the stauts of the file whether it is ready to commit to the github or not
ahele unstage cha stage garna ko lagi 
git add utsav.txt //to stage file-name 
or
git add .
or
git add --all sab files ko lagi 
git commit -m "Inital commit"
heroku create dipoapp
git push heroku master
heroku ps:scale web=1
heroku open



more on git:
git log --------shows the history
git log author="festivo1" -----shows the changes done by author festivo1


Edit the file on repository:
Differences of file on main repository and your file in local repository
command: git diff
	git add .
	git commit -m "second commit" // until you hit this command no changes in the git repositories but remember one thing git diff doesn't show any difference for the staged files

Changes more than one files:
same procedure

How to see the diff on staging area and git repositories
git diff --staged


How to remove files:
command:git rm fileName.txt // remove the file from git repository and working copy but it really deletes after commiting
git commit -m "deletes the file called fileName.txt"


renaming the file:
command: git mv second.txt pudding.txt  //moving is like renaming
everything you have done must be commited to have changes in teh file


command: git checkout -- index.html // this command takes out index.html from the git repository into the current working directory. used for undo changes


Command to unstage the staged files
command: git reset HEAD fileName.txt


creating new branch and merging it into the master branch

       git checkout -b dwav1.0
 2036  ls
 2037  vim newfile.txt 
 2039  git commit -a -m "created new branch"
 2041  git checkout master 
 2042  git merge dwav1.0 
 2043  ls
 2044  vim newfile.txt 
 2046  git remote add origin https://github.com/festivo1/distributorwebapp
 2045  git push origin master

pushing created branch to github:
command: git push origin dwav1.0
